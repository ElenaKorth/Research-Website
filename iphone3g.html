            The <i>iPhone 3G</i> was announced on June 9, 2008 and released on July 11.
            As the name suggests, this iPhone was able to connect to the 3G networks that the first iPhone couldn’t.
            Some of the new features included a built-in GPS and more storage space. The <i>iPhone 3G</i> was also considerably cheaper than the original iPhone.
            It was $199 for the 8GB model and $299 for the 16GB model. The 16GB model was $200 cheaper than the original 4GB model.
            The 16GB model was available in either black or white. It was the first iPhone that offered official color options.
            After the iPhone 3GS was released the 3G remained on sale but only the 8GB was available for $99.
            The <i>iPhone 3G</i> was discontinued 2 years later, on June 7, 2010. The <i>iPhone 3G</i> was larger than the original, though it had the same size screen and resolution.
            Compared to the aluminum backing of the original iPhone, this iPhone had a polycarbonate plastic housing.
            The power and volume buttons were changed to metal instead of plastic. It also had slightly longer battery life.
            The Wall Street Journal’s Walt Mossberg called it, "a more capable version of an already excellent device."
            The <i>iPhone 3</i>, for the most part, ran on OS 2, 3, and 4. For a time when the OS 4 update was released it was not entirely compatible with the <i>iPhone 3G</i>.
            The OS 4.2 update resolved some issues regarding unavailable features, but no more OS updates were available for the <i>iPhone 3G</i> afterwards.
