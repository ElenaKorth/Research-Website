            The <i>iPhone 5</i> was announced on September 12, 2012 and released on September 21.
            This phone was much thinner and taller than the previous iPhones. It featured a 4 inch screen with 640 x 1,136 pixels.
            The 16GB model was $199, the 32GB $299, and the 64GB $399.
            Pre-orders for the new iPhone started on September 14 and 2 million orders were placed within the first 24 hours.
            The <i>iPhone 5</i> had an aluminum based body that made it lighter and thinner than older iPhones.
            It was also the first iPhone to use the lightning connector. It also had a Sony-made 8 MP camera.
            The reviews were mostly positive but there were a few reviews complaining about purple tinted photos and the backing chipping off.
            There was also a bit of controversy regarding the new charger making some accessories no longer usable.
            The <i>iPhone 5</i> was discontinued at the same time as the 5C was announced on September 10,2013.
            It was the first phone to not become the discount version with the release of the next.
            The <i>iPhone 5</i> was only ever in production for twelve months, becoming the shortest lasting iPhone at the time.
            The <i>iPhone 5</i> supported iOS 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10. Since the iPhone 5 was 32-bit, it was unable to support iOS 11.
