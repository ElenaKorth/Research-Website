            The first iPhone was announced by Steve Jobs, the CEO of Apple, on January 9, 2007.
            It didn’t go on sale until June of that year. The price of the <i>iPhone</i> was $499 for the 4GB model and $599 for the 8GB.
            In the first weekend of its release, over 270,000 <i>iPhones</i> were sold. 74 days after the release, the millionth iPhone was sold.
            It was also named the 2007 Invention of the Year by the Time magazine.
            The <i>iPhone</i> received mostly positive reviews. The New York Times, The Wall Street Journal, Newsweek, and USA Today all reviewed the phone.
            The reviews were both positive and cautious. The New York Times and The Wall Street Journal both seemed worried about AT&T 2.5G EDGE network’s slow speed.
            Walt Mossberg, of The Wall Street Journal, stated, ”Despite some flaws and feature omissions, the iPhone is, on balance, a beautiful and breakthrough handheld computer.”
            The <i>iPhone</i> had an aluminum back, a 3 ½ inch screen, and 480x320 pixel resolution. The back camera had a resolution of 2 megapixels.
            The phone had all the same buttons and switches as the newer ones with the addition of the home button at the bottom center of the screen.
            September 5, 2007, apple dropped the price of the 8GB iPhone to $399 and the 4GB was discontinued.
            In February of 2008 a 16GB <i>iPhone</i> was released for $499. iOS 1, 2, and 3 were supported on the original <i>iPhone</i> before it was discontinued in July of 2008.

            The <i>iPhone 3G</i> was announced on June 9, 2008 and released on July 11.
            As the name suggests, this iPhone was able to connect to the 3G networks that the first iPhone couldn’t.
            Some of the new features included a built-in GPS and more storage space. The <i>iPhone 3G</i> was also considerably cheaper than the original iPhone.
            It was $199 for the 8GB model and $299 for the 16GB model. The 16GB model was $200 cheaper than the original 4GB model.
            The 16GB model was available in either black or white. It was the first iPhone that offered official color options.
            After the iPhone 3GS was released the 3G remained on sale but only the 8GB was available for $99.
            The <i>iPhone 3G</i> was discontinued 2 years later, on June 7, 2010. The <i>iPhone 3G</i> was larger than the original, though it had the same size screen and resolution.
            Compared to the aluminum backing of the original iPhone, this iPhone had a polycarbonate plastic housing.
            The power and volume buttons were changed to metal instead of plastic. It also had slightly longer battery life.
            The Wall Street Journal’s Walt Mossberg called it, "a more capable version of an already excellent device."
            The <i>iPhone 3</i>, for the most part, ran on OS 2, 3, and 4. For a time when the OS 4 update was released it was not entirely compatible with the <i>iPhone 3G</i>.
            The OS 4.2 update resolved some issues regarding unavailable features, but no more OS updates were available for the <i>iPhone 3G</i> afterwards.

            Another feature was the removal of the home button, and with it Touch ID.
            To replace it came Face ID. Face ID uses dot projectors, flood illuminators, and infrared cameras to accurately use someone face to unlock the phone.
            There was a bit of controversy regarding the “notch” at the top of the screen, though it became more popular with time.
            The back cameras on the <i>iPhone X</i> were dual 12 megapixel. Its camera was praised as the best smartphone camera at the time.
            The front camera is a 7-megapixel True Depth camera. The development of the technology for the <i>iPhone X</i> started in 2012.
            In July of 2017 the design for the new iPhone was leaked revealing the lack of a home button and the Face ID features.
            The phone comes in either Space Gray or Silver. It has a glass backing and is meant to be water and dust resistant.
            The <i>iPhone X</i> supports iOS 11-14 and 15 but some iOS 15 features are unavailable for it.
