            The first iPhone was announced by Steve Jobs, the CEO of Apple, on January 9, 2007.
            It didn’t go on sale until June of that year. The price of the iPhone was $499 for the 4GB model and $599 for the 8GB.
            In the first weekend of its release, over 270,000 iPhones were sold. 74 days after the release, the millionth iPhone was sold.
            It was also named the 2007 Invention of the Year by the Time magazine.
            The iPhone received mostly positive reviews. The New York Times, The Wall Street Journal, Newsweek, and USA Today all reviewed the phone.
            The reviews were both positive and cautious. The New York Times and The Wall Street Journal both seemed worried about AT&T 2.5G EDGE network’s slow speed.
            Walt Mossberg, of The Wall Street Journal, stated,” despite some flaws and feature omissions, the iPhone is, on balance, a beautiful and breakthrough handheld computer.”
            The iPhone had an aluminum back, a 3 ½ inch screen, and 480x320 pixel resolution. The back camera had a resolution of 2 megapixels.
            The phone had all the same buttons and switches as the newer ones with the addition of the home button at the bottom center of the screen.
            September 5, 2007, apple dropped the price of the 8GB iPhone to $399 and the 4GB was discontinued.
            In February of 2008 a 16GB iPhone was released for $499. iPhone OS 1, 2, and 3 were supported on the original iPhone before it was discontinued on July 15, 2008.
